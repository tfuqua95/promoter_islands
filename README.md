A data respository for our manuscript: "The emergence and evolution of gene expression in genome regions replete with regulatory motifs." The manuscript is available here: https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/98654

Within this repository you will find the Supplemental Data files as well as a Jupyter Notebook "Fuqua_et_al_revision.ipynb" to recreate the analyses used in this study. 

For the Jupyter Notebook, we strongly recommend creating an Anaconda environment using the package versions in this study. To create a new environment, enter the following command into your command line: conda install -n <env_name> requirements.txt
If this does not work, you may also manually download the packages listed within "requirements.txt" file.
